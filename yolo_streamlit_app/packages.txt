This file tells Streamlit Cloud to install the necessary system-level dependencies.

## Why This Happens

- **`opencv-python`**: Regular OpenCV package that includes GUI functionality and requires display libraries
- **`opencv-python-headless`**: Stripped-down version without GUI components, perfect for servers
- **System libraries**: Even the headless version needs some base graphics libraries, which `packages.txt` provides

## Your Final File Structure
```
your-project/
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt  (with opencv-python-headless)
└── packages.txt      (new file with system dependencies)
